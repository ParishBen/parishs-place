            <h2> My Turn to Tech</h2>
            <p>  In University, I studied a subject that was far from Computer Sciences in Criminology.  Yet, I’ve gradually moved closer and closer to a tech role in every position I’ve held since college. I started off working in the private sector doing asset protection for a major retailer. I found myself time and time again wondering about the tech equipment involved and began fixing cameras, connections,  securing & maintaining the files amongst other small fixes. Then came the investigative software and transaction monitoring on the computers that grabbed my attention. The report capabilities entwined with and live data  and alerts fascinated me. I dug into it at a level that they created an entire new position for me to conduct these awesome software-based investigations! I was entirely a consumer of the software programs and was just discovering my curiosity as to how these programs truly ‘operate’ to make my job so much easier!  It goes without saying you can easily take for granted so much hard work in the tech that makes life incredibly more convenient.       I then jumped into the public sector as a Crime Analyst and found myself again losing myself deep in investigations stationed at the monitor. Again,  being a consumer and developing a greater appreciation of incredible programs. One day I eventually ordered some books and downloaded some apps to see what all this coding and software jazz was. I really was drawn to the problem-solving side of things. Then quickly admired the level of creativity and options available when putting those problem solving skills to the test. There’s seemingly endless possibilities when it comes to tech development which makes it all the more exciting of a career path.  It will be without a doubt a life-long journey of learning and challenging myself, which I’m excited to embark on!</p>
